# jrd
> json resource descriptor, as specified by https://www.packetizer.com/json/jrd/

this tiny crate provides a struct representation for Json Resource Descriptors, with serde traits derived

get more information on its usage on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/jrd/latest/jrd)

## why
this crate is tiny and does very little, mostly piggy-backing from Packetizer's documentation

i found myself writing this and the docs for myself while working on a project, to have better
hints around JRDs, so I thought others might find it useful and decided to share it publicly
